# Timestampd

**Timestampd** is a simple Minecraft client-side mod that adds timestamps to chat messages. This mod is designed to work seamlessly alongside other chat-related mods, such as Chat Heads, ensuring that your chat remains organized and informative without interfering with other enhancements.

## Features

Timestamps in Chat: Automatically adds a timestamp (in hh:mm:ss format) to every chat message, allowing you to easily track when messages were sent.

Client-Side Only: This mod operates solely on the client side, meaning it does not affect gameplay mechanics or require installation on a server.

## Requirements
 - Minecraft 1.21
 - Neoforge 21.0.167+

## Configuration

- Currently, Timestampd does not include any in-game configuration options. The timestamps are automatically added to all chat messages.
